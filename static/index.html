API: Timestamp Microservice

User stories:

1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

Example usage:

https://myprtfl.herokuapp.com/api/timestamp/v2/Today
https://myprtfl.herokuapp.com/api/timestamp/v2/"5 days ago"
https://myprtfl.herokuapp.com/api/timestamp/v2/"January 1, 1970"
https://myprtfl.herokuapp.com/api/timestamp/v2/1355313600
...

Example output:
{"unix":0,"natural":"January 1, 1970"}
{"unix":1355313600,"natural":"December 12, 2012"}
